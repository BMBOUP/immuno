We use the algorithm of guyot. al 2012 to reconstructing individual-level time-to-event data based on the published Kaplanâ€“Meier curves of the randomized controlled trial (Rittmeyer et al. 2017). This algorithm is available in code R based on the inverse of the Kaplan Meier equation.

After reconstruction, we get in this dataset the following variables.

- time : vector of observed failure times.

- event: vector of indicator of status (0 for censoring, 1 for type of event).

- tmt.arm.number: vector of treatment indicator (1 if treated and 0 otherwise).

- treatment.type: the type of treatment immonotherapy or chemotherapy
